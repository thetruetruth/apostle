On April 19, there were reports that the General Motors concern announced the termination of activities in Russia with the closure of dealerships and the dissolution of the staff. It would seem that the phrase “GM is leaving Russia” has been heard without interruption for the past few years, but this time everything is really serious. So, it's time to trace all the milestones of history from beginning to end.

## American "Brazilians" in Tatarstan

The Americans were the first to realize that the wild market, which had barely begun to take shape after the collapse of the USSR, held enormous potential. Already in 1995, they rented part of the premises of the Yelabuga Automobile Plant and founded the GM-ElAZ joint venture: a quarter of the capital belonged to General Motors, and the rest to the governments of Russia and Tatarstan. Why Yelabuga? The fact is that even then there was a regime of a special economic zone, which made it possible to seriously save on customs clearance.

The first brainchild was the Chevrolet Blazer SUV, and it looked natural: the mid-nineties, Land Cruiser, Cherokee and Tahoe are already driving on the streets of Russia, so why not offer another model at a tempting price? But this price turned out to be not as low as expected, and instead of the American original, slightly disassembled “Blazers” in the Brazilian specification came to Russia - with simplified equipment and a much more “herbivorous” design.

As a result, the demand turned out to be negligible: instead of tens of thousands of SUVs, only about three thousand were sold, after which the company switched to the production of Opel Vectra sedans using the same SKD method - that is, in fact, bumpers and wheels were screwed to them.

But nothing happened here either: they managed to assemble something around 200 cars, after which the default of 1998 struck, and soon the enterprise's activities were completely stopped. By the way, remember the charged "tens" VAZ-21106 with two-liter Opel engines? So, the "legs" of these engines grow from this story.

## Shniva - seriously and for a long time

By the early 2000s, business contacts had already been established between GM and AvtoVAZ, which led the Americans to the most important and successful decision for the entire time of their presence in Russia. In Tolyatti, the second generation Niva was developed and prepared for production, but the financial situation of the plant did not allow for full-fledged production. But the car is good, promising - so why not add the only missing ingredient?

{{< img src="https://apostle.rezzamula.com/img/u5eb7C0.jpg" width="1024" height="698" alt="Photo: autowp.ru" caption="Photo: autowp.ru" >}}

Investments in the joint venture amounted to about $ 100 million, along the way, the Americans finalized the design of the car - and released it to the market under their own brand, with a branded "butterfly" on the radiator grille. It worked! The success turned out to be deafening, because there were no direct competitors in Russia in terms of price, cross-country ability and relative civility.

Annual circulations consistently exceeded 50 thousand copies: after the financial crisis of 2008, they sank by half, but soon returned to their previous levels. At the same time, second-stage shops were being built in Tolyatti, and together with the Italian bureau Blue Engineering and Design, a completely new, already third Niva was being developed. Its concept (and in fact a ready-made pre-production prototype) was shown at the Moscow Motor Show in 2014 with the intention of launching production in 2016.

But it was at this time that the Russian economy fell under the first packages of sanctions, the project was delayed. And in the end it was canceled altogether. The only legacy of that unborn Niva is the design of the front end, adapted to the restyling of the old Shniva. Which for two years now has been like not Chevrolet, but again Lada: at the end of 2019, GM withdrew from the joint venture and sold its stake.

## "Avtotor" almighty

Having barely put Shniva on its feet, people from General Motors decided to come to grips with the localization of their own models. In 2004, a contract was signed with the Kaliningrad Avtotor, which by that time had already produced BMW and Kia cars. Soon the “screwdriver” assembly of crossovers and SUVs began: Chevrolet Trailblazer and Tahoe, Hummer H2, even Cadillac Escalade.

However, this was only the beginning of cooperation: already by 2006, having invested about 80 million euros, GM was launching the full cycle production of Chevrolet Lacetti at Avtotor, with welding and painting of bodies - the design capacity of this branch alone was 50 thousand cars a year. Subsequently, Chevrolet Cruze, Captiva, Orlando, Aveo and Epica, as well as various Opels: Astra, Zafira, Insignia and Meriva will leave the gates of the Kaliningrad enterprise.

At the peak of production, more than one hundred thousand cars were produced here a year, and the total volume of all GM models assembled in Kaliningrad exceeded 600 thousand copies! But everything changed overnight, when in 2015 the American concern made a political decision to completely stop the production and sale of its mass-produced cars in Russia.

Avtotor had to freeze half of its capacities and cut about 500 staff, and the subsequent expansion of cooperation with Hyundai and Kia only partially compensated for these losses.

## Residents of the Northern Capital

By the middle of the 2000s, General Motors was doing so well in Russia that the concern decided to build its own plant. St. Petersburg was chosen as the place: in 2006, the construction of a new factory began in the Shushary region. And while it lasted, GM worked out logistics and trained personnel at the Arsenal plant in St. Petersburg - since 2007, Opel Antara and Astra, as well as Chevrolet Captiva, have been assembled there using the SKD method.

The grand opening of the plant in Shushary took place on November 7, 2008. The design capacity was up to 70 thousand cars annually, and by 2011 it was almost reached: more than 60 thousand copies were assembled. The emphasis was placed on mass models - all the same Cruze, Captiva, Antara and Astra.

However, it soon turns out that General Motors missed the changes in the market. Just in those years, the heyday of the “state employees” of the new wave (Solaris and the like) began to flourish, to which the Americans did not find an adequate answer. The Chevrolet Cobalt sedan of the Uzbek assembly did not find a response from buyers, the elderly Aveo model moved from Kaliningrad to the GAZ Group conveyor in Nizhny Novgorod, but also slowly lost ground.

In any case, we will never know how this story could end, because the plant in Shushary was closed in the same sad year for GM in 2015 and mothballed. And he stood like that for the next five years, until Hyundai bought the site.

It is planned that in the future a wide range of models will be produced there, last autumn the workshops were re-equipped - but, according to some reports, the general condition of the factory turned out to be depressing and required large investments. How the situation will develop in the new reality, when even the main conveyors of Hyundai are idle, is difficult to predict.

## Schrödinger business

Having thundered on all possible news with words about leaving Russia, General Motors actually did not go anywhere. Obligations for warranty service of mass models were observed in full, the supply of spare parts went without interruption, and dealers traded brand new cars as if nothing had happened.

{{< img src="https://apostle.rezzamula.com/img/S3u2b0B.jpg" width="1440" height="900" alt="Photo: Shutterstock" caption="Photo: Shutterstock" >}}

True, these were already purebred "Americans" - Chevrolet Tahoe, Camaro and Corvette, as well as "Cadillacs" of all stripes. The latest high-profile debut was the new-generation luxury Escalade, and the Chevrolet Trailblazer crossover even indicated GM's readiness to return to more democratic segments.

But, apparently, now these plans are not destined to come true: in the long history of large investments, successes and failures of General Motors in the Russian market, an end is being put. Although we do not rule out that GM will return.
