Russian President Vladimir Putin, during a telephone conversation with Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, apologized for Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov's remarks about Jews and anti-Semitism, Bennett's office [said](https://www.gov.il/he/departments/news/spoke_putin050522).

The Kremlin's [message](http://www.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/68356) following the conversation between Putin and Bennett did not include an apology from the Russian president.

A request was send to Presidential Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov.

Lavrov, in an interview published on May 1 by Mediaset, [stated](https://tg24.sky.it/mondo/2022/05/01/lavrov-russia-intervista) : “[Ukrainian President Volodymyr] Zelensky puts forward an argument: what kind of Nazism can they have if he is a Jew. I may be wrong, but Hitler also had Jewish blood. It means absolutely nothing. The wise Jewish people say that the most ardent anti-Semites are, as a rule, Jews. So he answered the question of how Russia can "denazify" Ukraine if its president is a Jew.

Zelensky said that Lavrov's words are an "anti-Semitic attack" and the head of the Russian diplomatic department "transfers the blame for the crimes of the Nazis to the Jewish people." Bennett [called](https://www.gov.il/en/departments/news/spoke_crime020522) Lavrov's statements a lie.

Israeli Foreign Minister Yair Lapid said the Russian government should apologize to Israel and the Jewish people for the minister's words. Lapid called Lavrov's remarks "unforgivable and outrageous" and said they were "a terrible historical mistake". “Accusing the Jews themselves of anti-Semitism is the lowest level of racism against Jews,” he stressed.

Chief Rabbi of Russia Berel Lazar called Lavrov's statements shocking: "It would be nice if he apologized to the Jews and simply admitted his mistake."

After the statement of the head of the Russian Foreign Ministry, the Russian Ambassador to Israel was summoned to the Foreign Ministry for clarification.

On May 3, the Russian Foreign Ministry released a statement in response to Lapid's words. It said that Israel supported Kyiv, where a "neo-Nazi regime" was taking shape, and anti-Semitism "flourished". The statements of the Israeli minister in the Foreign Ministry were called "anti-historical." “The Jewish origin of the president is not a guarantee of protection from rampant neo-Nazism in the country,” the ministry is sure.
