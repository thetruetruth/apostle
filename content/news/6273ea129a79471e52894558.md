Russian President Vladimir Putin congratulated Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett on the independence day of his state, the Kremlin press service [reported](http://www.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/68356) .

Mutual interest was expressed in the further development of friendly Russian-Israeli relations and the maintenance of useful contacts between the leadership of the two countries.

Putin and Bennett also stressed the importance of Victory Day. The Russian president reminded the Israeli prime minister that out of the 6 million dead Jews, 40% were citizens of the USSR. In turn, Bennett noted the decisive contribution of the Red Army to the victory over Nazism.

In addition, the heads of Israel and Russia discussed the situation in Ukraine, paying special attention to humanitarian aspects, including the evacuation of civilians from the territory of the Azovstal plant. The Kremlin noted that the Russian military remains ready to ensure the safe exit of civilians, and the authorities should order the remaining militants at the plant to lay down their arms.

Last week, Lavrov, in an [interview](https://www.mid.ru/ru/foreign_policy/news/1811569/) with Italy's Mediaset, suggested that Nazi Germany's leader Adolf Hitler may have had Jewish roots, saying that "the most ardent anti-Semites are usually Jews." In this way, he reacted to the question of why Ukraine needs “denazification” (the Russian authorities call it one of the goals of the military operation), if President Vladimir Zelensky is a Jew. According to Lavrov, this argument "means absolutely nothing."

These statements caused indignation of the Israeli authorities. Bennett [called](https://www.gov.il/en/departments/news/spoke_crime020522) them lies, the purpose of which is "to blame the Jews themselves for the most terrible crimes in history that have been committed against them, and thereby exonerate the enemies of Israel from responsibility."

Israeli Foreign Minister Yair Lapid considered Lavrov's words unforgivable, stressing that accusing Jews of anti-Semitism is demonstrating "the lowest level of racism against Jews." He also demanded that the Russian government apologize to Israel and the Jewish people, noting that these words "crossed the line" at a time when Jerusalem is making every effort to maintain good relations with Moscow. The Russian Ambassador was summoned to the Israeli Foreign Ministry.

The Russian Foreign Ministry, in turn, called Lapid's statement "anti-historical" and "largely explains the course of the current Israeli government to support the neo-Nazi regime in Kiev."

Lavrov's statements were also condemned by leaders of other states: Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau [called](https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/trudeau-calls-russian-foreign-minister-s-hitler-comments-ridiculous-and-unacceptable-1.5885335) them "absurd and unacceptable", Italian Prime Minister [Mario Draghi](https://www.reuters.com/article/ukraine-crisis-lavrov-draghi/italys-draghi-calls-lavrovs-comments-on-jews-and-hitler-obscene-idUSR1N2T3026) called them  obscene, and US State Department spokesman [Ned Price](https://www.state.gov/briefings/department-press-briefing-may-2-2022/) called them  "the lowest form of racism." Zelensky, in turn, [considered](/news/627044119a7947843b9041fc/) Lavrov’s words an “anti-Semitic attack”, which indicate that “in Russia they forgot all the lessons of the Second World War, and maybe they never learned these lessons.”
