President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky, in his video message on Telegram, called the words of Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov that the most important anti-Semites are Jews themselves, and that the leader of Nazi Germany Adolf Hitler could be of Jewish origin, was an “anti-Semitic attack”.

“How could such a thing be said on the eve of the anniversary of the victory over Nazism?” he asked. According to the Ukrainian leader, Lavrov’s words mean that the head of the Foreign Ministry “transfers the blame for the crimes of the Nazis to the Jewish people”, and “in Russia they forgot all the lessons of the Second World War, or maybe they never learned these lessons.”

Zelensky asked about the future of relations between Russia and Israel, in particular, whether the Israeli ambassador would remain in Moscow.

Lavrov, in an interview with the Italian Mediaset (his transcript [is](https://www.mid.ru/ru/foreign_policy/news/1811569/) available on the website of the Russian Foreign Ministry), suggested that “Hitler also had Jewish blood,” but admitted that he could be wrong. “The wise Jewish people say that the most ardent anti-Semites are usually Jews,” he also said. In this way, Lavrov responded to the question of why Ukraine needs “denazification” (the Russian authorities call it one of the goals of the military operation), if Zelensky is a Jew.

The Russian minister's statements aroused indignation among representatives of the Israeli government. Foreign Minister Yair Lapid demanded that Russia apologize to Israel and the Jewish people, pointing out that Moscow "crossed the line." Lapid stated that Lavrov's remarks are "inexcusable and outrageous" and are also a historical mistake.

Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennet [called](https://www.gov.il/he/departments/news/spoke_crime020522) the words of the head of the Russian Foreign Ministry a lie, the purpose of which is "to accuse the Jews themselves of the most terrible crimes in history committed against them, and thus free the oppressors of the Jews from their responsibility." On May 2, Russian Ambassador to Israel Anatoly Viktorov was summoned to the Israeli Foreign Ministry.

Zelensky has repeatedly spoken about his Jewish roots. “I have Jewish blood. And I'm the president. And nobody cares, right? Nobody cares. Nobody asks me about it,” he [noted](https://www.timesofisrael.com/a-serious-man-zelensky-bids-to-address-ukraines-dark-past-brighten-its-future/) in an interview with the Times of Israel in 2020. “The people of Ukraine cannot have the germs of anti-Semitism and Nazism at the genetic level. It cannot be in the heart or in the soul of the Ukrainian people who survived Babi Yar on their land, ”he [said](https://www.president.gov.ua/ru/news/u-narodu-ukrayini-yakij-perezhiv-babin-yar-ne-mozhe-buti-zar-70493) in September 2021.
