## What's happening

- A group of scientists from Europe and Canada studied the environmental pollution of the Arctic. The study [showed](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43017-022-00279-8?utm_medium=affiliate&utm_source=commission_junction&utm_campaign=CONR_PF018_ECOM_GL_PHSS_ALWYS_PRODUCT&utm_content=textlink&utm_term=PID100094349&CJEVENT=2cc07b07b59111ec83c8289f0a180510) that the region is suffering from a large amount of plastic that has found its way into the air, ocean, ice, snow, seabed and coasts.
- Most plastic waste breaks down into microplastics less than 5 mm in size, invisible to the naked eye. This is [dangerous](https://www.vice.com/en/article/z3n73e/the-entire-arctic-ecosystem-is-awash-in-plastic-pollution-dire-study-reports) , because the microplastic particles are absorbed by marine life, which are then eaten by humans.
- In deep-sea sediments, the concentration of microplastics was 13 thousand particles per 1 kg of sediment.
- Plastic is also dangerous for marine animals because it enters the respiratory tract, causing animals to suffocate and die. In addition, animals can accidentally eat plastic trash, get tangled in nets and become trapped.
- Dark-colored microplastic particles seep into ice and snow. Because of this, the snow darkens, reflects sunlight worse and melts faster. Global warming is accelerating and sea levels are rising. This is a serious problem, because the Arctic [is warming](https://oceanconservancy.org/protecting-the-arctic/) twice as fast as other areas of the Earth.
- There are several main sources of plastic pollution in the Arctic: equipment from fishing boats, plastic waste from local communities, sewage, and rivers that carry plastic into the ocean from remote parts of the mainland. The Arctic Ocean makes up only 1% of the total volume of the world's oceans, but it accounts for 1/10 of the world's river runoff.

## What does it mean

More than 380 million tons of plastic end [up](https://www.condorferries.co.uk/plastic-in-the-ocean-statistics#:~:text=There%20is%20now%205.25%20trillion,their%20way%20into%20our%20oceans.) in the world's oceans every year. Because of this, more than 100 thousand marine animals die, including in the Arctic.

The problem of pollution in the Arctic has been studied for a long time. [Industrial and agricultural wastes from Europe and Asia flow](https://discoveringthearctic.org.uk/science/arctic-science/arctic-pollution/) into the Arctic Ocean basin , which, due to low temperatures, decompose relatively slowly. In 2019, a group of scientists from the Center for Polar and Marine Research. Helmholtz conducted research on the territory of the Norwegian Arctic archipelago of Svalbard and [found out](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-environment-arctic-plastic-idUSKCN1V41V2) that a liter of snow there on average contains about 14.4 thousand microplastic particles. In the same year, a group of American scientists also found microplastics, but already in the Arctic ice.

Microplastics, along with food and water, [enter](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/16/microplastics-from-european-rivers-spreading-to-arctic-seas-research-shows) the body of both animals and humans. How exactly it affects different living organisms is not yet fully understood, but laboratory studies [show](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/dec/08/microplastics-damage-human-cells-study-plastic) that microplastics do damage human cells.
