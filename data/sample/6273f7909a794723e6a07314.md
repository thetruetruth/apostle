Tesla and Space X founder Elon Musk will be its CEO within a few months after the deal to buy Twitter is completed, sources [told](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/05/elon-musk-expected-to-serve-as-temporary-twitter-ceo-after-deal-closes.html) CNBC. Prior to this, the question of who will lead Twitter after the purchase of the company by Musk was practically not discussed, the channel indicates.

Parag Agrawal has been the CEO of Twitter since December. As [Reuters](http://www.reuters.com/) reported , at a meeting of the company's employees, Agrawal told them that after the purchase of the social network by Musk, its future is uncertain.

Musk entered into a definitive agreement to buy Twitter for $44 billion on April 25. Shareholders of the social network will receive $54.20 for each ordinary share. The transaction is expected to close in 2022, subject to shareholder approval and regulatory approvals.

The day before, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) [reported](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001494730/000110465922056055/tm2214608-1_sc13da.htm) that Musk received $ 7.14 billion in funding to buy the social network from a group of investors, including the Binance cryptocurrency exchange, Qatar Holding LLC investment company and the nephew of the Saudi king Al-Waleed ibn Talala Al Saud.

Musk, after announcing the deal, called Twitter a "digital city square" where vital questions about the future of humanity are discussed, and also announced plans to make the social network "better than ever" by adding new features.

Prior to that, in early April, Musk became one of the largest shareholders of Twitter with a 9.2% share.
